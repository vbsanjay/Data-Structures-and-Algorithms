# Number Systems

A number system is a framework or set of rules for representing numbers. Here's a brief overview of some common types of number systems and their key characteristics:

1. **Decimal (Base-10) System**:
    - The most common system, used worldwide for most everyday calculations.
    - Uses ten digits: 0 through 9.
    - Each digit's place value is a power of 10 (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).

2. **Binary (Base-2) System**:
    - Primarily used in computing and digital electronics.
    - Uses two digits: 0 and 1.
    - Each digit's place value is a power of 2.

3. **Octal (Base-8) System**:
    - Less common, but sometimes used in computing.
    - Uses eight digits: 0 through 7.
    - Each digit's place value is a power of 8.

4. **Hexadecimal (Base-16) System**:
    - Commonly used in computing and digital systems.
    - Uses sixteen digits: 0 through 9, followed by A (10), B (11), C (12), D (13), E (14), and F (15).
    - Each digit's place value is a power of 16.

5. **Duodecimal (Base-12) System**:
    - Also known as the dozenal system.
    - Uses twelve digits, typically 0 through 9, plus additional symbols or digits for 10 and 11.
    - Historically used in various cultures and occasionally in modern contexts.

6. **Roman Numerals**:
    - An ancient system used in the Roman Empire, with symbols like I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.
    - Represents values through a combination of addition and subtraction rules.
    - Largely replaced by the decimal system for everyday use.

7. **Base-n Systems**:
    - Generalized systems where "n" can be any integer greater than 1.
    - The base determines the number of unique digits and the place value system.

# Positional Notation

Positional notation is a method of representing numbers where the value of each digit in a number is determined by its position within the number and by a base or radix. This concept underpins most modern numerical systems, like the decimal (base-10), binary (base-2), octal (base-8), and hexadecimal (base-16) systems.

### Key Features of Positional Notation
1. **Base/Radix**:
   - The base, or radix, defines the total number of distinct digits used in the system. For example:
      - In base-10 (decimal), there are 10 digits (0–9).
      - In base-2 (binary), there are 2 digits (0, 1).
      - In base-16 (hexadecimal), there are 16 digits (0–9, A–F).

2. **Positional Value**:
   - The position of a digit in a number determines its value. This value is a power of the base.
   - In decimal, positions represent powers of 10 (10^0, 10^1, 10^2, ...). In binary, it's powers of 2 (2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ...), and so on.

3. **Calculation of a Number's Value**:
   - To determine the total value of a number, multiply each digit by the appropriate power of the base and then sum the results.
   - For example, in the decimal number 345, the value is calculated as:
   - ```math
     3 x 10^2 + 4 x 10^1 + 5 x 10^0 = 300 + 40 + 5 = 345
